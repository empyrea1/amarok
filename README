# Amarok - the audio player for KDE

There are many media players around these days, it's true. What's missing from most
players is a user interface that doesn't get in the way of the user. How many
buttons do you have to press for simply adding some new tracks to the playlist?
Amarok tries to be a little different, providing a simple drag and drop interface
that really makes playlist handling easy.

    * Music library
    * Cross platform: Support for Unix, MacOS X and Windows
    * Plays all audio formats known to man

    * Learn about your music with integrated Wikipedia
    * Full Last.fm support
    * gpodder.net support
    * Configurable on screen display for track changes

    * Integration with Plasma and KDE Applications
